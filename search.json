More than 1,100 people had been killed; some 240 had been dragged back to Gaza as hostages. It was clear from the outset of the war in Gaza, now six months old, that Israel’s two main goals—to eliminate Hamas and to free the hostages—were at odds. It was also clear that invading the territory, in which 2.2m people live cheek by jowl and under which Hamas had built a labyrinth of fortified tunnels to help it withstand an attack, was going to be immensely difficult. And there was always the risk that war in Gaza would spiral into a bigger conflict. It is possible to look at this unpromising starting point and conclude that Israel’s invasion of Gaza has not gone badly—and many Israelis take just that view. After all, Hamas’s fighting capacity has been massively reduced, with little in the way of Israeli casualties. Some of the hostages have been released and negotiations continue in an attempt to free the remainder. And all the while, there has been no regional conflagration, nor even much unrest in the West Bank (the more populous of the two Palestinian territories) or among Israelis of Palestinian origin.","tags":["test"]},{"title":"more-writings","path":"/2024/03/25/more-writings/","content":"这个排版不看好。主题的设置也没有哇。","tags":["test"]},{"title":"test","path":"/2024/03/25/test/","content":"[TOC] protected访问修饰符的范围？顺便回顾一下java的四种访问修饰符的权限： 修饰符 同一个类中 子孙类（同包） 子孙类（不同包） 其他包 修饰对象 备注 private ✅ ❎ ❎ ❎ 类，变量，方法 只允许在本类中访问 default ✅ ✅ ❎ ❎ 类，变量，方法 同包可以访问，不允许跨包（与protected对比） protected ✅ ✅ ✅&#x2F;❎ ❎ 变量，方法 覆盖default，只允许跨包的子类访问自身实例继承来的方法或者属性 public ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ 类，变量，方法 覆盖default，允许跨包","tags":["测试一下"]},{"title":"Hello World","path":"/2024/03/25/hello-world/","content":"Welcome to Hexo!
